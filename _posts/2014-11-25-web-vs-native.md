title: The battle between web and native apps
---

The debate between web apps and native apps is a tough one as I tend to use both for different reasons: easier accessibility and the features that each app has to offer. It also depends are where I'm accessing these apps. Desktop? Tablet? Mobile? For example: using spotify. When I'm working on my desktop computer, I'm not a fan of installing applications to my hard drive unless it is necessary. The reason for that is because it sometimes slows the speed of my computer which can end up crashing everything (maybe because my computer is a little bit on the older side but even with a more advanced system, I would still choose web apps over native). So instead, I would use spotify's web application rather than downloading it my hard drive. Accessing spotify through my mobile and tablet, on the other hand, I do prefer the native app more just because I can't really access it as a web app anyways. Don't get me wrong. There are some native apps that I prefer over the web ones, like yelp for instance, but as I continue to list which is better than the other, I find myself contradicting my reasons as it is not a black or white answer.

<b>Web Apps</b>
<p>Web apps are usually written in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and a server-side languages (or a web application framework of the developer’s choice) so it is a common code based across all platforms. The beauty of using a web app one less step for the user’s need to update. The updates on the app is usually updated through the web server so there is no need to manually update (I am very forgetful when it comes to updating) and the user can still access it just fine. Web apps runs in the mobile device’s web browser so there may be some features and quirks they have on their own but that also means they have limited access to the phone’s feature and information such as the camera and gps. If you are a web developer who is looking to create the next tinder (or something like that) app, it may be a little bit difficult to market your app as it will not get listed to the mobile’s preferred marketplace since most sales and listings are listed in something like The App store, Google Play, etc.

<b>Native Apps</b>
<p>Native apps take a little bit more time to developed and can be very costly. They usually require their own development process (IOS, Android) and in order for the app to successfully market itself, it needs to be suitable for multiple operating systems. That means that the app will most likely need to re-coded which also means more time and money spent. The interface and elements that the native apps have to offer is definitely a step up from web apps. Users usually prefer the sleeker design and the performance speed as it is faster than a web app and the unique features that the app can access to on their mobile device like their camera for Instagram or the GPS for Yelp. While this is not always a con for everyone, it can be for those who are not always up to date on their phone’s software and apps. For native apps, updates must be manually downloaded and installed unless they choose the automatic update option. If you’re like me, chances are you don’t always automatically update everything just to save storage and battery life so that youtube app of yours may not want to work tomorrow since the last time you update it was about 6 months ago. Another thing about native apps is that you don’t need a web browser. That can also be either a pro or con for some users but there are some apps that doesn’t require Internet connection meaning that you can still access to the app that doesn’t require the browser.

<b>Recommendations</b>
<p>I’m a humble person so asking me to choose something is like twisting my arm off since I tend to see both good and bad side of things. As I stated before, this is not a black and white answer on which one is a clear winner. It’s like choosing between coffee and tea, everyone has different preferences (I actually prefer coffee; black and filled with anger). It comes down to the developer’s goal of creating the app and what they are trying to achieve and what programming languages do they know. How much time they are willing to put into the development and what’s their budget? What I do recommend is doing your research and if you are a newbie who are interested in getting into the world of programming, don’t be afraid to start off small (like learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript) as it is a stepping stone to the bigger picture: your next great app.
