<h2>Why I'm Here</h2>
I never wanted something so bad in my life to be great at something. I used to think I would be some what good in an industry that turns out to be ugly despite how beautiful and glamourous everyone made it seem. Don't get me wrong, I loved that I'm allowed to be creative and I also loved that I can make someone happy about themselves without the need to get into therapy. I'm not talking about being a dominatrix here, I was doing hair! I loved the craft of it and playing chemist when trying to figure out the perfect color for a client's hair shade but I hated that I had to really claw my way to the top while dealing with drama and the backstabbing. The ugly side of the beauty industry left me mentally exhausted and I didn't have that much of a passion to want to continue on. 

While I still loved doing hair, I couldn't help but think about my first love which was web design. I remember the age of 14/15 when geocities gave you the taste of creating your own web page and I was eagered to learn more. Soon enough, I was learning about the basics of html and css through <a href="http://www.lissaexplains.com/" target="new">Lissa Explains</a> and found an awesome community of people having their own personal domains for blogging, creations, and everything else to interact with others on the Internet. My first personal domain was lipstick-n-bruises.com named after a Lit song. Since having my own domain, I continued to learn how to code and absolutely fell in love with it. To this day, while still in the beauty industry, I would continue to create websites for friends and small businesses. Obviously my love for the web never stoppede which is why I am here today, continuing my education to become a web developer and hopefully one day to teach kids how to code as well.
